# DataStructures  
Java implementations of certain data structures  
  
## Data Structures:
- [x] Binary Search Tree
- [x] AVL Tree
- [x] Hash Table

This project was created to simplify assignments for the CSC2001F computer science course at UCT, as well as providing myself with a set of robust Java data structures to refer back to in future if required.

The data structures are made using Java generics, such that any appropriate data/key types can be stored therein.
